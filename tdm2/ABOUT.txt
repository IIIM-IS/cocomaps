Second iteration of the cocomaps Task Dialog Manager (TDM). The
original solution is presented by Dr. Jacky Mallet an can be found
under tdm/.

Here the author canges the base structure to a deep tree. Using similar
structure as before. All tasks are defined beforehand and used to create
a tree structure : a query tree. 

First demo needs SLAM and simple conference between two robots. TDM isn't
really needed for that, the current tdm/ can be used as a hard 
coded search method : scanning the room.
